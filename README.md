This is my take on the Summer 2021 Shopify Web Development Internship Challenge.<br>
For this challenge I decided to use Angular 11 (latest verison) and Scss for styling.<br>
I tried to deliver a reliable and performant application.<br>
Hope you enjoy!ðŸ˜„

## Run the project

Install the dependencies by running `npm install` from the root directory.<br>
Once completed run `npm run start`.<br>
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.<br>
Enjoy!

## Extra features

I added the following extra features :
- Animations (Banner, result list, nomination list, loading)
- Nomination saved in LocalStorage
- Poster image to the movie card 
- Clear search field on click
- Error handling 
- Error notifaction banner.

### Some features were included in the code but commented out
I included some features that I thought were intresting at first but than decided not to include them in the 'deployed' project since I thought they were a bit invasive.<br>
If you want to check them out there's the search for: **'Unreleased Feature'** and uncomment the comment block below.
